Welcome to the Awesome Biomedical Knowledge Graphs repository! This project aims to curate and share resources related to Biomedical Knowledge Graphs (BKGs), a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing biological data. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field of biology or data science, this repository is a valuable resource for you.

## News
2023/9/8 This project is actively under development. 

Feel free to **STAR** and **WATCH** to stay updated with our progress.

## Overview

In this repository, we gather recent advancements in BKGs. We provide a taxonomy that effectively categorizes different BKGs, along with explanations of the techniques and applications involved.

Our objective is to assist researchers and practitioners in gaining a deeper understanding of this burgeoning field. Your participation and contributions are highly encouraged to help foster growth and knowledge sharing within the BKG community.
